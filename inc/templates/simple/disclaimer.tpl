		<p><strong><font size=2><?php echo $config['site_name']; ?> is a free URL redirection service that is intended for the sole purpose of converting long URLs in to short URLs.
The use of our service for spam or any other illegal activity is strictly prohibited and will result in the deactivation of the offending URL(s), as well as a complaint to be filed with the offender&#39;s ISP.
In addition, you may not use this service to redirect to websites that are illegal in nature or that contain adult-rated content.
<p>This service is provided without warranty of any kind.
Although we strive to be the very best by providing reliable 99.9%+ uptime service and never expiring URLs, we cannot guarantee anything.
In fact, no website can. For this reason, it is your responsibility to keep a backup of your source URLs. </p> </font></strong>
